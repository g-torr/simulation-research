# simulation-research
This folder contains the main codes for the research model for simulation. 
It consists of three systems:
- Umbrella simultations of two simple peptide:
    - beta hairpin 
    - alpha helix
- Passage of ions through a channel.
Unfortunately, only the data for electric data is self container. The umbrella simualation requires lots of files that are not available anymore.
